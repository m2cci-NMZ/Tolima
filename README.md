# tolima

Tolima is a from scratch (using no third party libaries such as OpenGL) 3D engine I wrote for educational purposes, mainly to learn C++. It reads object files with right hand triangles and renders them in white using flat shading. the SDL library deals with displaying the scene.
To navigate in the scene, you can use standard FPS controls.

## Dependencies
SDL

## Usage
./tolima file.obj

Keyboard navigation in the scene:
- `z` translates forward
- `s` translates backward
- `q` translates left
- `d` translates right
- `a` rotates left
- `e` rotates right
- `w` translates up
- `x` translates down
